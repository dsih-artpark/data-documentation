  comments: 
    - 2011 - Asia1 re-emerged after 5 years.
    - 2012 - All KA districts were included under FMDCP in Phase 2.
    - 2013 - 4th round of vaccination carried out in Jan/Feb 2013 but outbreaks occured in a few pockets in July/Aug. The fifth round was carried out in september, during the peak of outbreak.
    - 2016 - ELISA test changed from Liquid Phase Blocking (LPB) to Solid Phase Competitive (SPC).
    - 2016 to 2019 - LPB Elisa random sampling data absent in last few years. Percent protected data available pre and post vaccination.
    - 2018 - National Investigation team was assigned a task of investigating FMD outbreak in an organized farm at Dharward.
    - 2020 - A new sampling scheme was adopted. Samples are collected from three different age groups of animals viz 6-12 months, 13-24 months and >24 months at a ratio of 5:4:1 as per OIE guidelines.
    - 2021 - SPCE was correlated with the gold standard method VNT to determine the test cut-off for protective antibody status. Based on the results, the antibody titre cut-off of â‰¥1.65 log10 (@ 35 PI) was found to be appropriate at the herd level. This cut-off was further validated by testing more numbers of serum samples (n=440) and was found fit-for-purpose for assessment of protective antibody titre under NADCP/LHDCP-FMD.
    - 2022 to 2023 - Pre-vac samples for Kalaburagi, Shivamogga and Uttara Kannada were leaked or insufficient, and post-vac samples for Belagavi, Haveri and Tumakuru were leaked or insufficient.
